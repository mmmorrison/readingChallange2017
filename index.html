    <h1 class="text-center">2017 Reading Challenge</h1>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <p>This is a reading challenge that's actually a challenge. Instead of just reading a lot books, this challenge will force you to expand your horizons and read outside your comfort zone, no matter what zone that may be.</p>

        <p>There are two ways to do this challenge:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Easy Mode: For every book you read, check off each item that applies. If you find a paperback Science Fiction Dystopia written by a woman pre-1950 featuring an LGBT character originally published in a foreign language, go ahead and mark all those off. This a great mode for slow readers, ensuring you'll still be well rounded in the end.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>Hard Mode: One book, one check. The only exception is #52, which you'll see why when you read it. That gives you 52 weeks to read 51 books, because life is hectic and we all need an extra week sometime.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Good luck, and happy hunting.</p>
